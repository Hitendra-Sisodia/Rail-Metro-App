# Rail Metro Using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization

## Introduction

This C++ code implements a real-time use case of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source metro station to every destination station in Dehradun. In this project, we consider each station as an integer value starting from 0. When the user enters the source station, Dijkstra's algorithm is applied to calculate and display the least number of stations from the source to every other station.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)
